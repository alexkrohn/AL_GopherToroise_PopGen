# Alabama Gopher Toroise Population Genetics

This repository includes data and scripts necessary to reproduce the analyses performed in our recent paper on the population genetics of Alabama Gopher Tortoises. 

The scripts assume that this repo is your current working directory. The main VCF, outputted from [ipyrad](https://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/en/master/), is stored on GitLab (to be updated upon publication). The scripts assume you download and store this file in the `data` folder.

Raw reads associated with this data are uploaded to NCBI's Short Read Archive (PRJNA947629), availabe September 30th, 2023, or upon publication, whichever comes first.
